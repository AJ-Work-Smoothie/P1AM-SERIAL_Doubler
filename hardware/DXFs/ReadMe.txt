The "drills" file isn't your typical drills file. It's unlike the gerbers where it actually tells you where to drill. 
The drills file is the **OUTLINE** of the pads of the PCB. To make holes, add a terminal block footprint and align the
pads with the outlines you see in the drills file. 

*Import DXFs into Eagle with a line width of 0.1, otherwise the circle cutout will show as whole.
