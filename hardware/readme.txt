The male "splayed" pins can be found here: 

Digikey Part# 952-3263-ND
Manufacterer Part# M20-8771042

The female pins are just the typical 2.54mm pitch female pin headers with the pins manually "splayed" as they don't sell female headers like that. 

The file in the the RETIRED folder have been tested, and they WORK. However, the board dimension DXFs have since been updated to better fit into the proto module. I created a new a new eagle .sch & .brd & GERBERs to reflect these new changes, but they have not been physically tested yet! They **SHOULD** work but not having physical proof, I'm going to keep the retired ones in until I order the new boards.
